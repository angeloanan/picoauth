## stateless-first

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Session provider
    - JWT is stateless
    - Cookie requires some kind of KV store, could be in-memory or redis or other rust alternative
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Storage provider
    - libsql only, other solutions are simply too overkill for my purposes
- ‚ùó Notification provider
    - email is stateless, requires SMTP config that's set-and-forget
